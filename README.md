# Workflow Viz with HoloViz+Bokeh for Biomedical Research in Neuroscience

## What?

TODO: Short description

<details>
<summary>Element vs Community?</summary>
<br>
This repo contains the development work and the demonstration of workflows at two blurry levels - element and community. Element workflows are combined and adapted to become the building blocks for specialized scientific community workflows. That is, the goal of an element workflow is to be generalizable and the goal of a community workflow is to be well-contextualized.
</details>

The current **element workflows** are (TODO: add links):

1. Ephys Viewer (in progress, info, demo notebook, real data, simulated data)
2. Waveform Viewer (in progress, info, demo notebook, real data, simulated data)
3. Spike Raster (in progress, info, demo notebook, real data, simulated data)
4. EEG Viewer (in progress, info, demo notebook, real data, simulated data)
5. Video Viewer (in progress, info, demo notebook, real data, simulated data)

The current **community workflows** are:

1. Spike Motif Viewer (in progress, info, demo notebook, real data, simulated data)
2. MNE EEG App (in progress, info, demo notebook, real data, simulated data)
3. Minian CNFM App (in progress, info, demo notebook, real data, simulated data)

## How?

### Develop/Contribute

Tasks related to these efforts are collected this [project board](https://github.com/orgs/holoviz-topics/projects/1).

Notes and discussions are logged in this repo's GitHub [Wiki](https://github.com/holoviz-topics/neuro/wiki).

"Every workflow, an island" *- probably no one* (But every workflow should have its own environment file).

To assist with development using real data, some workflows utilize simple data simulators (in progress) to help benchmark across data and parameter space.

Additionally, the Wiki has some notes (in progress) on data specifications for certain modalities (TODO: add link when exists).

## Why?

**Why "Biomedical Research in Neuroscience"?**

Multiple (probably all) HoloViz+Bokeh developers believe that helping people through the furthering of clinically impactful science is a worthy pursuit, but also in need of a data visualization boost.

**OK, but why "Workflow Viz with HoloViz+Bokeh"?**

Our hypothesis is that the visualization (perception through the eyes) within the process of working always benefits from having the option to suddenly become interactive and shareable - allowing for the poking or plucking, pushing or pulling, drilling in or out, grouping or separating, and sending or receiving of what would otherwise be a static snapshot of the data. The combined use of HoloViz and Bokeh tools provides the interactivity and shareability needed to support research as a collective action rather than a collection of solitary observations.

## Who?

This work is a collaboration between developers and scientists. While some contributions are visible through the GitHub repo, many other contributions are less visible yet equally important. Here is a (hopefully) complete list of contributors in no particular order, as of early 2023:

- James Bednar
- Demetris Roumis
- Ian Thomas
- Mateusz Paprocki
